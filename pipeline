MAKE SURE YOU ALREADY DOWNLOADED THE .YML FILE WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENT FILE. IT WILL CONTAIN ALL THE DEPENDENCIES TO RUN THE COMMANDS BELOW. 
IN THIS TUTORIAL, IT IS ALREADY GIVEN FOR DOWNLOAD AD A MOOC.YML FILE.

1. How to download datasets? 
(data for this sample using the following command (the sample identifier below is the accession number for the data in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA))

                                                                 fastq-dump --split-files ERR5743893 (2 files will be downloaded)

2. Make sure to have a reference sequence. 
It can de downloaded from ENA as well. In this tutorial, it is given in a fa.zip file and it is already downloaded in this repository.

3. To be in the deisred environment,Run                           Conda activate MOOC                          

4. Create a folder for the report:                                 mkdir -p QC_Reports 
5. Perform Quality check using: 
                                    fastqc ERR5743893_1.fastq ERR5743893_2.fastq --outdir QC_Reports
(Report is saved in the created folder)
6. We’ll use a tool called multiQC to summarise the fastqc outputs. 
It’s a clever tool as it has been designed to recognise and parse the the outputs from a number of commonly used bioinformatics tools. 
In the QC_reports directory, run the following command:
                                                                   multiqc .

7. Open the multiaq report in the web browser. Go to the folder and double click on the file.
