#PREPARE THE ENVIRONMENT#

MAKE SURE YOU ALREADY DOWNLOADED THE .YML FILE WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENT FILE.
IT WILL CONTAIN ALL THE DEPENDENCIES TO RUN THE COMMANDS BELOW. Make sure that the .yml and the data files to be used are in the same folders.
IN THIS TUTORIAL, IT IS ALREADY GIVEN FOR DOWNLOAD AD A MOOC.YML FILE.
    -  cd into the folder contaning the env.yml **FILE**
    -  conda activate env

##Prepare dataset##

1. How to download datasets? 
(data for this sample using the following command (the sample identifier below is the accession number for the data in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA))

                                                                 fastq-dump --split-files ERR5743893 (2 files will be downloaded)

2. Make sure to have a reference sequence. 
It can de downloaded from ENA as well. In this tutorial, it is given in a fa.zip file and it is already downloaded in this repository.

3. To be in the deisred environment,Run                           Conda activate MOOC                          

4. Create a folder for the report:                                 mkdir -p QC_Reports 
5. Perform Quality check using: 
                                    fastqc ERR5743893_1.fastq ERR5743893_2.fastq --outdir QC_Reports
(Report is saved in the created folder)
6. We’ll use a tool called multiQC to summarise the fastqc outputs. 
It’s a clever tool as it has been designed to recognise and parse the the outputs from a number of commonly used bioinformatics tools. 
In the QC_reports directory, run the following command:
                                                                   multiqc .

7. Open the multiaq report in the web browser. Go to the folder and double click on the file.

# Mapping the sample to the reference#

The reference genome is a thorough, well-annotated depiction of a species’ genetic makeup. 
It serves as a standard template for mapping because it offers a thorough blueprint of genes, regulatory components, and other genomic properties.
There are several critical steps in the read mapping process. First the reference genome is prepared for alignment by performing genome indexing. 
This generates an index similar to a book index and enables mapping algorithms to search the genome and find matches with sequencing reads. 
However, this process is only necessary once for each mapping software, which is noteworthy.
The mapping result is a SAM format. The SAM file has a unified format for storing read alignments to a reference genome. 
It has 11 fixed columns and the optional key:type:value tuples.

Please refer to the following for SAM format. (https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/assets/ce/72/hero_ce728418-d25b-4d85-943d-ed87e6cab341.png)

A Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report (CIGAR) string offers a succinct overview of the alignment’s structure, 
enabling effective representation of alignments and conserving storage space. 
It is especially helpful for highlighting complicated alignments with insertions, deletions, and mismatches.
Bioinformaticians can recreate the alignment and comprehend how the read relates to the reference sequence by decoding the CIGAR string.

Please refer to the following for CIGAR. (https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/assets/54/dd/hero_54dd4ca4-4f27-43fa-8a49-876150fe9640.png)

1. First let’s create a directory to store the results from BWA-MEM:                           mkdir Mapping
2. The first step of the mapping process is to index the reference genome. 
Indexing is a key method for increasing the effectiveness of data access and retrieval in databases and computer systems. 
It makes data access quicker and more effective, lessens computational complexity, and supports advanced querying procedures.
                                                                                              bwa index **REFERENCE**.fasta 
The code above creates the index of the reference sequence.
3. Now, we’re ready to map the sequences from our target sample to the reference genome with the following code:
                                                                                    bwa mem REFERENCE.fasta ERR5743893_1.fastq ERR5743893_2.fastq > Mapping/ERR5743893.sam

4. Once BWA MEM has finished running, change to the Mapping directory and list the files:
                                                                                      cd Mapping  ls -lhrt
5. To save on space and speed up downstream analysis, we’re going to convert the SAM file to a BAM file using samtools (you’ll need to come out of the Mapping directory first):
                                                                                     
                                                                                          cd ..
                                                                                    samtools view -@ 20 -S -b Mapping/ERR5743893.sam > Mapping/ERR5743893.bam

The Samtools options have different meanings. Running “samtools –help” gives a detailed description of all options. In our context, the options imply:
@ - number of threads, S - input is a SAM file, b - output should be a BAM file

6. By default the SAM and BAM file we created is sorted by the order of the reads in the fastq files.
It’s a lot more useful for these files to be sorted based on the order they were mapped
(i.e. we want a BAM file of reads and mapping information ordered by where in the reference genome those reads were aligned). 
We’ll use samtools to do this:
                                                                          samtools sort -@ 32 -o Mapping/ERR5743893.sorted.bam Mapping/ERR5743893.bam

For large files storage, git LFS has been downloaded and installed using Gitbash. Large files can be tracked with the following command: (cd in your repo first)

git lfs track "*.sam"
git add .gitattributes
git add Mapping/ERR5743893.sam
git commit -m "Add large SAM file via LFS"
git push origin main


7. Next we need to index the sorted BAM file. 
Briefly, we index BAM files to speed access to specific genomic regions and read data, allowing for effective variant calling, visualisation, and genomics research:

                                                            samtools index Mapping/ERR5743893.sorted.bam
8. You can now visualize your BAM file on Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) as shown in the screencast below:



###To use IGV, you need the reference.fasta and the index reference.fasta.fai###
##Instructions to use IGV##
(https://youtu.be/die924mosh0?si=NUi5QWlImCdx-a5E)
So I'm going to take you through IGV and how you can visualise your bam files with IGV. 
So how you do this-- you just need to search IGV on your browser. So if you just search IGV, then web app, and then click on the first one.
So that's the IGV web app. You can also download the desktop version and use the desktop one, but I'm going to use the web app. 
So once it opens, you need to load in your reference and then load in your bam file. So we're going to first load the reference.
So you just need to come and select on Genome. And because our reference is local, just choose Local File. And it should be in my Downloads. 
And then I'll just go and select. This is our reference. And you have to also select the index file. So you have to select both of them at the same time, then click on Open.
So the reference has loaded. We're now going to load our bam file. So click on Track, Local File. Then this is our bam file.
Remember, the one we've obtained from mapping to our reference read. So you still need to select both the bam file and the index file together. 
So once you select both of them, just click Open. Then your bam file will load. So it's going to take a few seconds or so to load. Yeah, there you go.
So this is your bam file. This is the name of the bam file. And then this is your reference at the top. So you can increase this, the size of your screen. 
So you can visualise your file sample well. And then, of course, if you click on any-- 
so these are reads So if you click on any read, it will just give you the information of that particular read. 
For instance, if I click on this one, it will tell me this is the read name, the alignment stat, and all this information about or concerning the read
