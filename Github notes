1. When working with Github, have all the datasets in the root repo.
2. Create the environment.yml file in the root repo. See *pipeline* for more info.
3. Use codespace to have the terminal and to create and activate the environment from the .yml file
4. If new files are created from the terminal, merge it before deleteing the codespace.
5. Either git add, commit push if there is no new files in the main repo or:

#Merge (safer, default) 
This keeps all commits and creates a merge commit:
                                                  git pull --no-rebase origin main
Once done: 
                                                   git push
