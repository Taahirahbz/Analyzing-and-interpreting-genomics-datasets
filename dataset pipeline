Create a text file called samples.txt in your working directory. Copy and paste the ENA accessions below into this file:

ERR5556343

SRR13500958

ERR5743893

ERR5181310

ERR5405022

Now we can use a for loop to run fastq-dump on each of the accessions in samples.txt:

for i in $(cat samples.txt);do fastq-dump --split-files $i;done
It’s always good practice to save disk space where we can, so let’s compress the fastq files we just downloaded with gzip:

gzip *.fastq
Now create a directory called data and move the fastq files there:

mkdir data
mv *.fastq.gz data
