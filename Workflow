###Every command used (on codespace named workflow)for workflow analysis as per tutorial shall be listed as w1., w2., ect.. ABOVE the following notes.
###Every file generated from that workspace shall be named as wfile1, wfile2, ect...


You were introduced to some of the most commonly used bioinformatics programs like FastQC in Week 1. 
However, we may want to analyse large amounts of data using several different tools that each need to be run on our input files and the subsequent outputs.
You can imagine that waiting around for each of these tasks to complete before inputting the next command can be very inconvenient.
It would be much better if we were able to somehow chain these tools together so all the tasks are executed in one go. 
Fortunately, we can and when these tasks are collected together they are known as a workflow or a pipeline. 
These workflows typically involve the execution of different software tools with the output of one tool becoming the input to the next tool in the workflow.

Traditionally, bioinformatics workflows were written in general purpose programming languages such as bash, Perl or Python but, more recently, 
new specific workflow management systems such as Nextflow, Snakemake and Galaxy have been developed especially to manage computational data analysis workflows.

Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) are specialized systems designed to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow.
The major advantages of using WfMS are that they simplify the development, execution and monitoring of pipelines as well as allowing these workflows to be shared
ensuring that the same results can be obtained from the same data (i.e. they are reproducible) which is a key outcome for any scientific investigation. 

The key features of WfMS are:

Run time management: program execution on the operating system is managed for you. Tasks and data are split (‘parallelised’) to run at the same time speeding up your analyses.

Software management: containerisation technologies like Docker and Singularity/Apptainer that package software tools
and their dependencies are utilised natively by WfMS meaning pipelines can be deployed reliably on different platforms

Interoperability: pipelines can be run on different types of computing infrastructure from your own machine to a local cluster or cloud based services such as AWS or Azure.

Reproducibility: the use of software management and version control means pipelines will produce the same results when re-run on different platforms.

Resumption: continuous checkpointing allows pipelines to be resumed from the last successfully executed steps. 
This means you don’t have to restart the whole workflow if one of the steps fails or your computer decides to restart itself.
