1. Check dependencied in nf-core repo.
2. As per tutorial, environment MOOC has to be activated. (It has all the dependencies needed)
3. An environment is just a .yml file on the repo - it should first be created then activated as followd:

conda env create -f MOOC.yml
conda activate MOOC


4. If your GitHub repo already has a conda environment set up (via MOOC.yml), you don’t need to touch base. 
You just need to activate your environment and then install nf-core inside it. Here’s a clear way to do it on a GitHub Codespace or local clone:

Install nf-core
With your environment activated, install nf-core via conda:

conda install -c bioconda nf-core


This will install nf-core in your environment without affecting base. Bioconda channel contains bioinformatics tools, including nf-core.

IF OLDER VERSION OF ENVIRONMENT OR ONE WITH NO ALL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES ARE USED, PROCEED AS FOLLOWS:

5. Add the conda-forge channel and try again

Tabulate and many dependencies are in conda-forge, so it’s often enough to include that:

conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda nf-core  (conda-forge should come before bioconda in the command.)
This tells Conda to look in both channels for missing dependencies.

##Ways to make it persistent
There are ways to make your environment reproducible, so you don’t have to recreate it from scratch every time:

Use environment.yml (Mooc.yml)

If your repo already has an environment, you can just do:

conda env create -f MOOC.yml
conda activate MOOC


If nf-core is not in your MOOC.yml, you’ll need to install it separately (via conda or pip) after activating the environment:

Update MOOC.yml with nf-core
After installing nf-core once, you can update your MOOC.yml:

conda env export > environment.yml     
(Now, anyone who clones your repo, or you reopen the Codespace, can just do conda *env create -f MOOC.yml*    *conda activate MOOC* )
