Creating the samplesheet.csv file
Like most nf-core pipelines, viralrecon requires a CSV file containing the sample names and location of the fastq files input. 
The format of the samplesheet we’re going to use should look like this:

sample,fastq_1,fastq_2

SAMPLE_1,fastq_1_location,fastq_2_location

You can prepare this file in Excel or another spreadsheet program but remember to save the file as a CSV file.
Alternatively, nf-core provide a useful python script that can be used to generate the samplesheet automatically. First download the python script to your working directory:

wget -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/viralrecon/master/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py

Then run the python script:

python3 fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py data samplesheet.csv -r1 _1.fastq.gz -r2 _2.fastq.gz

The name of the directory you moved the fastq files to (data) comes first followed by the name of the file we want to create (samplesheet.csv)
then we specify the file suffixes of our fastq files (_1.fastq.gz and _2.fastq.gz) using -r1 and -r2 respectively.

If you didn’t get an error, you should find the samplesheet.csv file in your working directory.
To check what the script did, either print the file with cat on the command line:

cat samplesheet.csv
