The tools used to call variants

Several tools can be used for variant calling (GATK, Samtools, Freebayes). One of the most common outputs of variant calling is the variant call format (VCF). 
A VCF is a tab-delimited text, parsable by standard UNIX commands and can be compressed with BGZF (bgzip) and indexed with TBI or CSI (tabix).

An overview of key fields found in a VCF file include: (https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/assets/fc/03/hero_fc035324-235a-4750-a3cb-f232aec85592.png)

CHROM: Chromosome or contig name where the variant is located.

POS: Position of the variant on the chromosome or contig.

ID: A unique identifier for the variant, often used to link to external databases.

REF: The reference allele, representing the genomic base at the specified position in the reference genome.

ALT: The alternate allele(s), indicating the variant base(s) observed in the sample(s). Multiple alternate alleles can be represented.

QUAL: Quality score representing the confidence or quality of the variant call.

FILTER: Information about any filters or criteria used to determine the variant call, showing whether the variant met quality standards or particular significance thresholds.

INFO: A field containing additional information about the variant.
It includes various subfields denoted by key-value pairs, such as allele frequency, functional annotations, and predicted effects.

FORMAT: Defines the structure of sample-specific genotype and variant information. 
Specifies which fields are present for each sample, such as genotype quality (GQ), allele depth (AD), and more.

SAMPLE Genotype Fields: These fields provide genotype information for each sample at the variant position. 
Genotypes indicate the combination of alleles carried by each sample, often using numerical codes (e.g., 0/0 for homozygous reference, 0/1 for heterozygous, 1/1 for homozygous alternate).
